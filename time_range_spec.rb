require  './TimeWindow'
 
# Write a Ruby class which can tell you whether the current time 
# (or any given time) is within a particular "time window." 
 
# Time windows are defined by strings in the following format:
# 0700-0900 
# # means every day between these times
 
# Sat Sun 
# # means all day Sat and Sun, no other times
 
# Sat Sun 0700-0900 
# # means 0700-0900 on Sat and Sun only
 
# Mon-Fri 0700-0900 
# # means 0700-0900 on Monday to Friday only
 
# Mon-Fri 0700-0900; Sat Sun 
# # ditto plus all day Sat and Sun
 
# Fri-Mon 0700-0900 
# # 0700-0900 on Fri Sat Sun Mon
 
# Sat 0700-0800; Sun 0800-0900 
# # 0700-0800 on Sat, plus 0800-0900 on Sun
 
# Time ranges should exclude the upper bound, i.e. 0700-0900 is 07:00:00 to 08:59:59. An empty time window means "all times everyday". 


# Strategy:{
#   For each instance initialized with non-empty string, create a two level collection,
#   or an array of hash, keys of hash are days that included, values of hash are arrays of 
#   time that included at each day.
#   The include method should search over this array, first by keys than by vlaues.
# }
